# Spam Classifier Project

## Overview

Welcome to the Spam Classifier project! This repository contains a machine learning-based solution for classifying emails as spam or not spam. The project is implemented in Python and uses various natural language processing (NLP) techniques and machine learning algorithms to achieve accurate classification.

## Repository Contents

- `Spam_Classifier.py`: The main Python script that implements the spam classification logic.
- `Spam_Classifier.pdf`: A document detailing the methodology and approach used in the project.

## Features

- **Preprocessing**: Tokenization, stop word removal, and other text preprocessing techniques.
- **Feature Extraction**: TF-IDF vectorization to transform text data into numerical features.
- **Model Training**: Utilization of machine learning algorithms like Naive Bayes, SVM, or Logistic Regression for training the classifier.
- **Evaluation**: Performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to evaluate the model.

## Requirements

To run this project, you need the following packages installed:

- Python 3.x
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- NLTK

You can install the required packages using pip:

```sh
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn nltk
```

## Usage

To use the spam classifier, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/Misbah542/spam-classifier.git
   cd spam-classifier
   ```

2. Run the `Spam_Classifier.py` script:
   ```sh
   python Spam_Classifier.py
   ```

3. The script will preprocess the data, train the model, and evaluate its performance. The results will be printed to the console.

## Methodology

The methodology and approach for building the spam classifier are detailed in the `Spam_Classifier.pdf` document. It covers the following aspects:

- Data collection and preprocessing
- Feature extraction techniques
- Model selection and training process
- Performance evaluation metrics
- Discussion of results and potential improvements
